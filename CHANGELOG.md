# Changelog

All notable changes to `spec-superflow` will be documented in this file.

The format loosely follows Keep a Changelog.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.3] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- **Author field consistency across manifests**: `cmd-install-workbuddy.mjs`'s generated marketplace manifest had `author.name = 'MageByte-Zero'` (a repository path) instead of the brand name `MageByte`, and lacked the `author.url` field that every other manifest carries. It now follows the shared `{ name: 'MageByte', url: \`https://github.com/${GITHUB_REPO}\` }` shape. Six plugin/marketplace JSON files (root `plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` ×2, `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`, `.github/plugin/marketplace.json` ×2) also carried stale `"url": "https://github.com/MageByte-Zero"` in the author object — all nine owner/author URLs now point at `https://github.com/hrbitwise`.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-09-20

### Added

- **`ssf install-trae` command**: deploys spec-superflow for Trae CN (`~/.trae-cn`) and international Trae (`~/.trae`) editions. Detects CN first (fallback to international), copies runtime dependencies (`scripts`, `docs`, `templates`, `dist`, `hooks`) into a dedicated `spec-superflow/` plugin root so `ssf runtime asset read` resolves correctly, refreshes only the 9 spec-superflow skill directories in the shared global `skills/` tree (all third-party skills preserved), and writes a plain-markdown `phase-guard.md` into `user_rules/`. Supports `--local <path>`, `--tag <ver>`, `--trae-dir <path>`, and `--dry-run`.
- **`scripts/lib/cmd-install-trae.mjs` + `scripts/install-trae.mjs`**: the Trae installer implementation, factored as a standalone global-level installer (Trae has no project-level skills directory, unlike every other NEW_PLATFORMS entry). Reuses `rewriteSkillMarkdown` from `runtime-rewrite.mjs` and a source-name-only skill replacement granularity (same pattern as codebuddy) so unrelated global skills are never wiped.

### Changed

- **GITHUB_REPO constants migrated**: all 6 installers (`install.mjs`, `cmd-install-codebuddy.mjs`, `cmd-install-trae.mjs`, `cmd-install-workbuddy.mjs`, `install-cursor.mjs`, `install-zcode.mjs`) plus `SECURITY.md`, `ci.yml`, and `docs/release-checklist.md` now point at `hrbitwise/spec-superflow` instead of the retired `MageByte-Zero/spec-superflow`. One latent typo in `release-checklist.md` (`gh repo sync MageByte-Zero/awesome-codex-plugins` → the correct upstream `hashgraph-online/awesome-codex-plugins`) was fixed incidentally; the marketplace URL under `plugins/hrbitwise/spec-superflow/` follows the new owner path.

### Fixed

- **spec-writer template reference**: the `## Artifact Generation` section now uses explicit `ssf runtime asset read templates/<name>.md` commands for all four planning artifacts (`proposal`, `spec`, `design`, `tasks`) instead of a single backticked relative `templates/spec.md`. Trae and every other platform install must place runtime dependencies under a plugin root that `ssf` resolves via `__dirname/../..`, so a bare backticked path fails whenever the skill directory and the runtime root diverge. Contract-builder already used the correct form; spec-writer is now aligned.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-09-20

### Added

- **Quality Gates section in the execution contract**: `templates/execution-contract.md` now carries a `## Quality Gates` section binding delivery to both the result and the way it is reached — required checks with thresholds, per-check placement (local / CI / review), and a non-regression floor on existing thresholds. Five anti-bypass rules make it a hard constraint: a failing check may only be fixed by changing the checked code, never the check itself (tests, assertions, lint rules, type config, CI config); relaxing a standard requires prior user approval recorded in the contract; escape hatches (`--no-verify`, `@ts-ignore`, `eslint-disable`, `skip`/`todo`/`only`) must be declared and approved; existing tests may not be deleted or weakened to reach green; and a missing or unrun check must be reported as uncovered rather than as a pass. contract-builder maps the section from `design.md` plus the project's existing check setup and keeps the anti-bypass rules verbatim, and code-reviewer's new Anti-Bypass Check raises an unapproved weakening to Critical and requires a `fail` receipt.
- **Security baseline in the contract and the review path**: the contract's `## Quality Gates` section now carries two always-applicable checks — a secrets scan (no credentials, tokens, API keys, or private keys in the diff) and a dependency audit (every newly added dependency checked for known vulnerabilities via the ecosystem's audit command or an explicit manual review). `code-reviewer` gains a matching Security Baseline Check with severity mapping — a leaked credential or a newly added dependency with a known high-severity vulnerability is Critical, a missing or unrecorded check is Important — and the reviewer subagent template in `code-reviewer-prompt.md` carries the same questions, since the subagent reads the template rather than the skill. Where a project has no tooling for a check, it must be recorded as `uncovered` with the substitute used, per anti-bypass rule 5. `release-archivist` closes the loop with a new Full/legacy verification step (Step 5: Security Baseline) that re-verifies the baseline from evidence rather than assuming the review covered it — findings or unaudited high-severity dependencies are FAIL, a check claimed without evidence is WARN — plus a matching claim-evidence table row, a report dimension, and a Final Checks item.
- **Decision sources in `design.md`**: every Decision now carries a `Sources` field. External factual claims a decision rests on — framework/runtime guarantees, API contracts, version-specific behavior, performance numbers — must cite a specific document page plus its version or date (a bare domain does not count); purely internal trade-offs are labeled `internal`; a claim whose source could not be located is labeled `unverified`, which is legal and non-blocking, while fabricating a precise citation is forbidden. spec-writer enforces this in the design requirements, the decision red-team checklist, and the validation checklist; the `add-dark-mode` example demonstrates both the cited and `internal` forms.
- **Adversarial review mode and subagent context packs**: high-risk waves gain an alternative review method (`skills/code-reviewer/references/adversarial-reviewer-prompt.md`, dispatched instead of the standard wave review — same gate and receipt, not an extra gate). It triggers on irreversible actions (schema/data migration, deletion, authn/authz, payment, crypto), unfamiliar/unowned code spanning 3+ modules, a self-reported DONE_WITH_CONCERNS, or a relevant decision labeled `unverified`. The reviewer runs in a fresh context that deliberately excludes the implementer's report and conversation history, receives only the verbatim binding requirements, the design excerpt with Sources labels, and the diff, then works through CLAIM → EXTRACT → DOUBT → RECONCILE → STOP: embedded claims become falsifiable propositions, each is attacked with a concrete breaking condition, and a refuted or unresolved proposition on a high-risk path is a `fail` receipt with human escalation rather than an optimistic pass; a stronger model profile requires prior user approval with the trigger and cost disclosed. Separately, implementer dispatches now use an explicit Context Pack (`implementer-prompt.md`, mirrored in build-executor's per-task loop): verbatim binding contract/spec lines, relevant design decisions with Sources, and pattern file pointers are packed; conversation history, speculative explanations, unrelated file dumps, and other tasks' discussions are excluded, and on repairs the prior review report is labeled evidence-to-verify. An insufficient pack is a NEEDS_CONTEXT report, not a request to dump the repository.
- **Asset-reference integrity lint**: a new `asset-references` rule closes the blind spot of on-demand-loaded skill assets. It recognizes three reference shapes — repo-relative `skills/<dir>/<file>.md` paths, `ssf runtime asset read docs|templates/...` load commands, and backticked same-directory bare filenames — and reports a dangling reference as an error when the target does not exist. Placeholder runtime paths (`<wave-id>`, `[CHANGE_DIR]`) and ambiguous bare change-artifact names (`proposal.md`, `tasks.md`) are deliberately not judged (zero false positives). A non-`SKILL.md` asset with no inbound edge from any skill markdown is reported as an orphan warning; orphan checks run once per skill entry scan. A regression test asserts the current tree has zero dangling references and zero orphans.
- **Tiered token budgets for skill assets**: lint coverage now extends from `skills/*/SKILL.md` to every `skills/**/*.md` file. Entry docs keep 250 lines (error) / 20000 chars (warning); on-demand asset files get a tighter, role-appropriate budget of 220 lines (error) / 12000 chars (warning), calibrated just above the current maximum (211 lines / 9938 chars) so no existing file needs edits. The 15-line code-block rule applies to entry docs only — long fenced blocks are the body of prompt templates, not example code. Rules opt into asset coverage via `appliesTo: 'all'`; legacy rules default to entry-only, and both lint modes (default and `--include token`, including `--file`) now enumerate markdown assets recursively.
- **Skill assets relocated under `references/`**: the six on-demand prompt templates (`implementer-prompt.md`, `task-reviewer-prompt.md`, `re-review-prompt.md`, `writing-good-tests.md` under build-executor; `code-reviewer-prompt.md`, `adversarial-reviewer-prompt.md` under code-reviewer) move from the skill root into each skill's `references/` directory, aligning the tree with the documented supplementary-doc convention. All inbound references are updated to repo-relative full paths (including the former bare `re-review-prompt.md` mention), the runtime asset allowlist and version-consistency file list point at the new locations, and installers need no change because they already copy and rewrite skill directories recursively.
- **Three-tier entry budgets (controller / leaf)**: on top of the asset tier, `SKILL.md` entry docs now split into two budgets — the two state-machine controllers (`workflow-start`, `build-executor`) keep 250 lines / 20000 chars, while every leaf skill is capped at 210 lines / 12000 chars. The leaf thresholds are calibrated just above the current maximum (release-archivist at 195 lines / 9242 chars), so the cap blocks ratchet growth without forcing any existing edit; `resolveBudget(skillName, isEntry)` is the single source of the tier decision, and a direct rule invocation without file context falls back to the widest controller budget (legacy behavior).
- **Machine-readable `assets` declarations with four-quadrant lint**: the two asset-owning skills (`build-executor`, `code-reviewer`) now declare every on-demand asset in a YAML `assets:` list in their frontmatter. The `asset-references` lint enforces the full quadrant on entry docs — declared-but-missing is an error; on-disk-but-undeclared and body-referenced-but-undeclared are warnings; declared-but-never-referenced remains covered by the existing orphan check — so declaration, disk state, and body references cannot drift apart. Skills without assets need no field at all. Cross-asset references inside `references/` stay governed by the dangling-reference rule without being forced into the owning entry's manifest.
- **Token baseline covers every skill markdown**: `token-baseline.mjs` no longer relies on a hardcoded skill list. It dynamically enumerates all `skills/**/*.md` files, labeling entry docs `skill: <dir>` and on-demand assets `skill-asset: <rel>`, so token measurements can no longer silently miss a newly added reference file; the three fixed non-skill targets (session-start hook, always-loaded phase guard, `GEMINI.md`) are unchanged.

### Changed

- **Controller side-branches pushed into on-demand assets**: three low-frequency side procedures move out of the two controller entries into declared `references/` assets — build-executor's Batch Inline procedure (`references/batch-inline-execution.md`) and the Inline-mode `ssf checkpoint save` recovery step (`references/inline-checkpoint.md`), plus workflow-start's Optional Prototype Handoff (`references/prototype-handoff.md`, making workflow-start the third asset-owning skill). Each entry keeps only the trigger condition, the hard boundary, and a full-path read pointer; the moved text is preserved verbatim in the asset. build-executor drops from 224 lines / 20089 chars to 210 / 19955, clearing the only budget warning introduced by the frontmatter manifest; workflow-start drops from 242 / 19635 to 231 / 19566. The four-quadrant lint verifies all three assets are both declared and referenced. Installers, the runtime asset allowlist, and version-consistency file lists need no change — assets use the same backticked full-path read convention as `writing-good-tests.md` and installers copy skill trees recursively.

### Fixed

- **Recursive runtime rewriting for deployed skills**: every installer rewrote only the top level of a skill directory (`SKILL.md` plus sibling `.md` files), so markdown nested one level deeper — such as a `references/` subdirectory — kept its `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` placeholder and portable `ssf` invocations after deployment, leaving them broken on Cursor, Zcode, CodeBuddy, WorkBuddy, and the shared installer. The five duplicated copies are replaced by one shared `rewriteSkillMarkdown` helper in `scripts/lib/runtime-rewrite.mjs` that walks the deployed skill directory recursively; a regression test asserts a three-level layout (SKILL.md, sibling sub-prompt, nested reference) is fully rewritten.
- **Token rule mis-tiering direct callers**: when the token bundle was invoked without a context object, the skill-name argument (e.g. a test fixture named `test`) was fed into the tier resolver and fell into the leaf tier, so the documented "widest controller budget" fallback actually applied the 210-line leaf limit. Missing context now unambiguously selects the 250-line / 20000-char controller budget.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-18

### Added

- **Bearing-fact assumption scrutiny on short-path intake**: workflow-start's Direct Short-Path Intake now surfaces the riskiest self-certified facts for Quick and direct Hotfix. When `uncertainty`, `behavioral_constraint_change`, or `cross_module_change` has no concrete evidence in the request or repository, the same-turn Observed/Why display states the inferred value, what breaks if it is wrong, and the evidence searched (found or absent). No question round is added — the user's same-turn verification choice (`tdd`/`new-test`/`bounded`) confirms the assumptions — and a flipped fact refreshes `ssf workflow recommend` and returns the Quick-vs-Full choice to the user instead of auto-escalating.
- **Design-decision red-team self-check in spec-writer**: every `design.md` Decision is now pressure-tested before recording. Rejected Alternatives require disqualifying evidence (bare verdicts such as "simpler"/"better" are rejected), Consequences must be labeled evidence-backed or inferred (an inference names its assumption), and Risks must link to mitigation and verification evidence. Answers fill the existing Decision fields rather than a new section; gaps are resolved from the repository or a named assumption, pausing for the user only under the existing artifact-generation conditions while staying in `specifying`; unfilled red-team fields are explicit repair items in the DP-2 blind-reader check.
- **Missing-artifact guidance in spec-merger**: Exception Handling now covers a delta spec that is referenced but missing or unreadable — report the capability and path, write no target, and route back upstream to restore the file — explicitly distinguished from a legal empty "no deltas" change, which still exits cleanly.
- **Option-presentation contract in need-explorer**: multiple-choice questions and approach comparisons now follow a presentation contract — plain language, same-altitude mutually exclusive options, a marked evidence-backed default, per-option wrongness cost and reversibility, and a three-option ceiling; approaches are compared on one shared dimension frame (scope, risk, fallback, follow-up cost) with rejected-alternative reasons, a concrete scenario walkthrough, and an escape condition. When the user cannot evaluate an option, the agent must ask the prerequisite question first instead of re-explaining the same jargon menu; a new "user does not understand" exception forbids repeating the menu verbatim and requires descending one level.

### Changed

- **Skill character budget raised to 20000**: `MAX_CHARS_PER_SKILL` is raised from 10000 to 20000 characters; the 250-line limit remains the hard error ceiling. The old 10K threshold predated the state-machine expansion and forced the two controller skills toward deleting complete CLI flags and boundary rules.
- **Token-efficiency compression of controller skills**: workflow-start (271 → 242 lines) and build-executor (293 → 217 lines) were compressed to meet the 250-line hard limit without changing workflow semantics — all CLI flags, guards, adjudications, isolation rules, and regex-backed routing contracts are preserved; the repeated handoff template across both files was tightened.

### Fixed

- **Windows lint false-green**: `lint-skills.mjs` passed Windows paths (e.g. `d:\...`) directly to dynamic `import()`, which only accepts `file://` URLs; every rule failed to load, was swallowed by the loader's catch, and the script still reported "0 issues". Both loaders now convert paths with `pathToFileURL`, and a new regression test runs both lint modes in a child process to fail loudly if rules stop loading.
- **False exception-handling warnings from synonym gaps**: the rule now recognizes "missing templates" (spec-writer's template fallback) and DP-6 "verification outcome/failure" wording (release-archivist's verification gate) instead of only the literal words "validation failure"; genuinely missing guidance is still detected.
- **Windows-compatible decision-point timestamps (#117)**: `ssf state set <change-dir> dp_N_timestamp now` now generates the UTC ISO timestamp inside the Node.js CLI, and all skills use that cross-platform form instead of POSIX `date` command substitution.
- **Planless debugging for lightweight paths (#117)**: Quick, Tweak, lightweight, and direct Hotfix may record evidence-backed debug attempts and DP-5 escalation without an execution plan when their workflow receipt is valid; the ledger is sealed to the receipt's stable authorization identity, while Full and legacy Hotfix retain the current-plan requirement.
- **Accurate Codex hook guidance (#117)**: the platform matrix and installation docs now match the Codex manifest's explicit `hooks: {}` suppression and tell users to invoke `workflow-start` in new sessions.
- **Current Codex release pin (#117)**: direct marketplace examples now use v1.2.0, and `ssf version` keeps those `--ref` pins synchronized during future releases.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- **SDD adjudication recovery (#108)**: add `ssf execution adjudicate` to persist a confirmed, plan-scoped human decision after the repair circuit breaker opens. One authorization permits exactly one non-empty continuous follow-up review, preserves and revalidates the complete failure evidence chain, and never synthesizes PASS or releases dependent waves before a real passing receipt.
- **Worktree lifecycle management**: `ssf isolate <change-dir>` now recursively initializes submodules (`git submodule update --init --recursive`) in the new isolation context when a `.gitmodules` exists, and appends a cwd-persistence warning (isolation path + mandatory `cd` prefix rule) to `<change-dir>/.superpowers/sdd/progress.md` without overwriting existing records.
- **`ssf finish <change-dir>` one-command close-out**: locates the isolation worktree by branch name, refuses to run on uncommitted changes or merge conflicts, merges the isolation branch back to the trunk with `--no-ff`, verifies the trunk contains every isolation commit, then removes the worktree and the isolation branch. Exits non-zero with a "run `ssf isolate` first" hint when no isolation context exists.
- **`ssf finish` trunk verification gate**: `ssf finish <change-dir>` now runs a verification command on the main trunk (default `npm test`, overridable with `--test-cmd <command>`, 10-minute timeout) after the `--no-ff` merge and sync verification pass, before deleting the worktree and the isolation branch. A failed or timed-out verification keeps both the worktree and the isolation branch, prints the failure details, and instructs the user to return to the worktree, fix the issue, and re-run `ssf finish`.
- **`ssf` command on CodeBuddy installs**: `ssf install-codebuddy` now generates `ssf` / `ssf.cmd` / `ssf.ps1` command shims under `~/.codebuddy/spec-superflow/bin/` and registers that `bin/` directory on the user PATH (idempotent, Windows user environment / POSIX shell rc files). After install, `ssf` is available in a new terminal just like a global npm install. `--no-path` skips the PATH change while still writing the shims. `ssf uninstall-codebuddy` removes the shims and the PATH entry.
- **`ssf execution resync` stale-plan unlock**: refreshes the plan's artifacts_hash reference and migrates existing review receipts when non-semantic planning-document corrections (e.g. formatting fixes) make the plan stale; refuses to run with pending fail receipts, without --confirm/--reason, or when the plan is not stale.

### Fixed

- **Windows 8.3 short-path compatibility in isolation checks**: the `isSubpath` helpers in `ssf finish` and `ssf execution review` (worktree-lifecycle R5) now normalize paths with `realpathSync.native`, which resolves 8.3 short names (`C:\Users\RUNNER~1\...`). The JS `realpathSync` cannot resolve short-name components, so on CI Windows runners — whose TEMP is a short path — the cwd was wrongly flagged as outside the isolation worktree even when it was inside.
- **CI-stable `ssf finish` tests**: finish test helpers now inject git committer/author identity environment variables (CI runners have no global git identity, so `git merge --no-ff` failed with "Committer identity unknown"), and worktree-path assertions capture the `realpathSync.native` form before the worktree is removed.
- **Tests: no shell-string process invocation in `ensure-branch` tests**: replaced `execSync` template-string interpolation with `spawnSync` literal argv arrays (flagged as high-severity shell-injection pattern by the plugin scanner) and replaced the shell-based sleep with `Atomics.wait`.
- **`ssf execution review` rejects trunk-only commits**: before recording a review receipt, the head commit must be contained by at least one non-protected branch (`main`/`master` excluded). A head that only sits on `main`/`master` is rejected with a non-zero exit and no receipt is written; heads on an isolation branch (including one already merged back to the trunk) still pass.
- **cwd-escape WARN in `ssf finish` / `ssf execution review`**: when the change has an isolation worktree and the process cwd is outside it, both commands emit a WARN containing the worktree absolute path without blocking execution. No worktree → no WARN.
- **CRLF-tolerant risk ownership matrix test**: `verification-risk-ownership.test.mjs` now normalizes line endings so the matrix parses identically on Windows (CRLF checkouts) and POSIX.
- **Runtime infer counts numbered-heading tasks**: task counting in `infer-workflow` now includes numbered-heading lines (`### N.`) in addition to checkbox rows, so a heading-only tasks.md is no longer misjudged as having no artifacts (which forced Full-path recommendations).
- **`ssf resume` / `ssf switch` route next_action by content level**: when the execution plan exists and is valid, next_action routing now follows the eligible wave for build-executor instead of falling back to the raw state field, removing contradictions with continuation guidance.
- **Guard enforces tasks-checkbox-format on entering execution**: a new guard dimension blocks the approved-for-build → executing transition when tasks.md lacks template checkbox rows (`- [ ]` per task), catching non-conforming formats before implementation starts; the hotfix path applies the same tightened check.
- **Review P0–P3 resilience fixes**: `ssf execution resync` now migrates plan state item-by-item with an undo log — partial failures roll back to a self-consistent stale state instead of leaving a half-migrated plan; the recommendation overlay (`execution-recommendation.json`) is refreshed by `resync` under the same migration seal, with its artifacts hash updated and its seal recomputed; the review head-branch check no longer silently skips when the git root cannot be resolved — the review is rejected and the reason is recorded (R4/R5) instead; and the hotfix fast-path no longer requires the tasks checkbox format, restoring its original design intent (the full workflow keeps the tightened check).
- **Workflow-aware phase guard for quick/lightweight/tweak**: the guard no longer falls back to full-workflow artifact requirements for fast-path workflows. Planning-phase transitions (exploring→specifying, specifying→bridging) are rejected with a pointer to the correct fast path, unknown transitions fail with an explicit workflow-transition-unknown error, and a specifying→approved-for-build recovery jump is available; full behavior is unchanged, and legacy hotfix joins direct hotfix in rejecting planning-phase transitions (hotfix never goes through specifying).
- **Docs: per-workflow isolation policy**: build-executor preflight and workflow-start fast-path routing now spell out the per-workflow isolation policy (full/legacy hotfix isolate mandatory; quick/direct hotfix/tweak/lightweight edit on trunk).
- **`ssf finish` resilience and clearer sequencing**: worktree removal auto-falls-back to `--force` for submodule projects (manual cleanup commands printed if that also fails, with the merge commit called out), and the merge commit is printed immediately after a successful merge — before trunk verification starts — so the merge-vs-verify order is unambiguous.
- **Docs: physical archive ownership**: release-archivist now owns the `ssf finish` step after closing (full/legacy hotfix only; lightweight paths end at closing), workflow-start distinguishes the logical terminal from the physical archive, and build-executor preflight points to release-archivist instead of repeating finish details.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- **Evidence-backed DP-5 escalation (#102)**: replace raw `state set dp_5_*` writes with a guarded debugging-attempt ledger. `ssf debug attempt record/show` keeps failed fixes distinct from Wave Review repair failures, rejects duplicate or stale evidence, and `ssf debug escalate --confirm` requires at least three current attempts. Audit reports unsupported legacy DP-5 records instead of treating them as valid approvals.
- **Bounded automatic repair retries (#105)**: stop formal review repair after three unresolved failures instead of five. Every implementer retry must carry new failure evidence, an updated focused brief, and a changed strategy; the third unresolved failure returns control for user adjudication rather than dispatching another subagent.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- **CodeBuddy Code CLI installer**: `ssf install-codebuddy` deploys spec-superflow to `~/.codebuddy/` for CodeBuddy Code CLI. SessionStart hook is written to `~/.codebuddy/settings.json` (CodeBuddy's canonical hook location — the user-level `hooks/hooks.json` is not auto-loaded), recovery command adapters are rewritten to call the deployed local runtime instead of a pinned `npx` package, and `phase-guard.md` uses `alwaysApply:false` frontmatter so ordinary projects are not forced into the workflow. Adds `ssf uninstall-codebuddy` for precise, safe teardown.
- **Risk-adaptive execution**: Quick, direct Hotfix, Tweak, and Full paths now keep small changes bounded and reserve contracts, plans, and review receipts for higher-risk work.

### Changed

- **Faster test and review path**: reuses immutable Git validation and removes redundant test work, reducing the full local suite to about 141 seconds in the release-candidate run.
- **Clearer documentation**: Chinese and English homepages now lead with path selection, verification, and user-visible tradeoffs instead of workflow jargon.

### Fixed

- **CodeBuddy install/teardown safety**: `ssf uninstall-codebuddy` precisely removes spec-superflow's own artifacts (SessionStart entries in `settings.json`, runtime dir, commands, phase-guard rule, 9 skills) while preserving other skills, rules, hooks, and settings fields. The previous `rm -f ~/.codebuddy/hooks/hooks.json` advice, which deleted unrelated hooks, is replaced by the dedicated uninstall command. CI `platform-install-smoke` now covers CodeBuddy (settings.json SessionStart, command rewrite, phase-guard frontmatter).
- **Major-version release sync**: `ssf version` now preserves the requested major version when it updates documentation and runtime markers, so `ssf version 1.0.0` cannot produce `0.0.0`.

## [0.12.1] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed

- **Safe fast-path selection**: Quick now requires explicit risk facts and a user-selected verification strategy; Tweak and Hotfix enforce their documented boundaries instead of allowing an acknowledged downgrade to bypass Full.
- **Safe canonical publication**: `ssf sync` validates every active delta and computes the complete publication before writing. A malformed delta or a later merge failure cannot publish an empty or partial baseline, nor create a receipt.
- **Delta header compatibility**: Delta specs now recognize `### REQ-<ID>: name` and `### 需求：name` alongside the canonical `### Requirement: name` format.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- **User-controlled lightweight workflow paths**: Workflow recommendations now surface behavioral-constraint, API/schema, cross-module, new-module, and uncertainty risks without automatically escalating. Users can explicitly retain Quick for an eligible three-file single-module change by acknowledging the risk and recording `tdd`, `new-test`, or `bounded` verification.
- **Clearer four-mode guidance**: Quick, direct Hotfix, Tweak, and Full now document their file boundaries, decision points, and verification expectations consistently across the CLI, skills, and installation guidance.

### Fixed

- **Default artifact validation**: `npm run validate` now validates the bundled `docs/examples/add-dark-mode` example when no change directory is supplied, while retaining explicit-directory validation.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- **Closes #47 — Recovery workflow commands**: add `ssf resume`, `ssf switch`, and `ssf save` as a control-plane overlay. Resume/switch are read-only; save writes only the compatible checkpoint and never automatically commits, pushes, or syncs. WorkBuddy distributes the canonical `/ssf:resume`, `/ssf:switch`, and `/ssf:save` Markdown command adapters.
- **Closes #70 — Workflow path recommendation and selection**: `ssf workflow recommend/select/show` collects minimal intake facts, recommends full, hotfix, or tweak with reasons, and requires an explicit, auditable choice before workflow state routing continues.

### Changed

- **#65 — Planning artifact language inheritance**: proposal, specs, design, tasks, and execution contracts inherit the conversation language instead of defaulting to English.

### Fixed

- **#64 — closing 终态生命周期对齐**：将 `release-archivist` 验证、`spec-merger` 同步和归档确认明确为 `executing` 内的 pre-closing 收尾步骤；`closing` 是 `CLOSED` 成功终态，且没有 next skill。
- **#71 — Taskless hotfix closure**: hotfix changes without `tasks.md` can satisfy the closing guard after their minimal contract and required verification are complete.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- **#60 — Qoder 平台支持**：新增 `ssf install-qoder` 一键安装命令，部署 skills 到 `.qoder/skills/`、运行时依赖到 `.qoder/spec-superflow/`、phase-guard 规则到 `.qoder/rules/phase-guard.md`。采用共享库安装器模式（Pattern A），与 Cline/Kiro/Windsurf 等平台一致。平台支持数从 17 增至 18。

## [0.9.1] - 2026-07-15

### Changed

- **#52 — isolate optional name**: `ssf isolate <change-dir>` no longer forwards an absent optional name as the literal string `undefined`; explicit names and `--force` retain their existing behavior.
- **#43 — portable skill runtime**: all nine canonical skills no longer require `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`. Raw marketplace, cache, copy, and symlink loading use a semver-pinned package CLI; local installers rewrite that prefix to their bundled runtime tree.
- **Cross-platform runtime diagnostics**: `ssf doctor` now detects stale root placeholders and missing runtime trees, while version sync and CI consistency checks include all nine canonical skill prefixes.
- **Linked-worktree version hook**: `npm run setup-hooks` now locates Git's shared hooks directory, upgrades stale spec-superflow hooks, and validates the worktree being committed rather than a sibling checkout.
- **#45 — Execution-mode recommendation**: DP-4 now runs `ssf execution recommend` to list Inline, Batch Inline, and SDD from task and wave evidence, with a recommendation. Every persisted plan at `<change>/.superpowers/sdd/execution-plan.json` requires explicit `--confirm`; a non-recommended selection records `--acknowledge-recommendation` instead of treating Inline as an override. Named waves, dependencies, and review receipts remain mandatory.

### Added

- Runtime distribution inventory for all 17 documented platforms plus the ZCODE compatibility installer path.
- `npm run test:raw-mode` packages the current source and proves the canonical runtime works without plugin-root variables or a global `ssf` command.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- **#37 — Model profiles**：可在 `spec-superflow.config.json` 中为 `mechanical`、`standard`、`strong`、`review` 配置平台模型 ID，并用 `ssf config --resolve-model <profile>` 只读解析；不执行跨平台自动模型切换，也不新增 runtime dependency。
- **#38 — Minimality discipline**：code-reviewer 现要求用任务依据审查无请求的依赖、配置、抽象与无关重构；保留 TDD、验证、安全和错误处理，不引入 Ponytail 或任何 runtime dependency。

## [0.8.17] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed

- Fixed canonical delta spec paths: validation, guard checks, hashing, sync, examples, and docs now use `specs/<capability>/spec.md`.
- Fixed `ssf inject` default behavior so ambiguous projects require `--platforms` instead of writing every platform file.
- Fixed hotfix fast-path guards so hotfix can skip full planning artifacts while still requiring a fresh minimal contract and DP-3 approval.

## [0.8.16] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- **Plugin Scanner 门禁**：回归测试 `guard-tests-passing.test.mjs` / `guard-specs-merged.test.mjs` 此前用字符串形式 `execSync(\`node ${...}\`)` 触发 `SHELL_INJECTION_PATTERN`（8 high），改为参数数组 `execFileSync('node', [...])`。扫描分数 85/high:8 → 99/high:0 (A)。
- **产线 .mjs 硬化**：`ensure-branch.mjs` 去掉变量参数包装、改字面参数数组；`cmd-isolate.mjs` 去掉 `...extra` 展开；`config-loader.mjs` `execSync(字符串)` → `execFileSync(数组)`。均为去 shell 注入面的质量提升，运行时行为不变。
- **CI 稳定性**：`.github/workflows/hol-plugin-scanner.yml` 把 `ai-plugin-scanner-action@v1`（移动 tag，07-06→07-07 静默从 2.0.992 升到 2.0.997 导致门禁忽然挂掉）锁到 SHA `c4737ed2f724`（= 2.0.992），顺带修掉「Third-party Actions 未锁 SHA」中危项。

## [0.8.15] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- **BUG-A（致命）— `executing→closing` 收口跳转永久失败**：`release-archivist` 从不写 `test_result: pass`，而 `tests-passing` 守卫强制要求它，导致 `ssf state transition closing` 永远 `exit(1)`。现守卫同时接受 `dp_6_result` 以 `pass` 开头，且 `release-archivist` 在 DP-6 后显式执行 `ssf state set <change-dir> test_result pass`。
- **BUG-B — 状态漂移**：`cmd-state` 非 init 子命令在 `.spec-superflow.yaml` 缺失时静默返回默认态、会幽灵式创建状态文件。现缺失即报错退出；`state-loader` 增加 `spec_merged: false` 默认值并持久化。
- **#28 — `executing→closing` 缺「spec 已合并」闸门**：新增 `specs-merged` 守卫，残留未合并的 delta spec 会阻断收口；`spec-merger` 同步后置 `spec_merged: true`。
- **#15 — git 隔离仅为建议性、无强制**：新增 `ensure-branch.mjs` + `cmd-isolate.mjs`，拒绝在 `main`/`master` 上直接提交（除非 `--force`）；`build-executor` 的 `ssf isolate` 改为强制 pre-flight。
- **#26 / #27.2 — skill 依赖 PATH 解析的裸 `ssf`**：所有 `skills/**/SKILL.md` 改为安装时重写的绝对路径 `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/spec-superflow.mjs"`，修复 cursor / marketplace 用户必失败的问题。

### Added

- **#29 — ZCODE（gemini-cli）安装器**：新增 `install-zcode.mjs` + `cmd-install-zcode.mjs`，注册进 CLI；`INSTALL.md` 平台表补充 ZCODE 行。

## [0.8.14] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- **WorkBuddy 安装器重构** — `ssf install-workbuddy` 现在部署为标准 marketplace 插件，修复了 v0.8.13 中存在的三个缺陷：
  - **运行时依赖缺失** — 旧安装器不复制 `scripts/`、`docs/`、`templates/`、`dist/`、`hooks/`，导致 skill 中引用的脚本和模板无法解析。现在全部复制到插件根目录。
  - **`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` 未重写** — 旧安装器直接复制 SKILL.md 而不重写路径变量，导致所有脚本引用断裂。现在重写为 marketplace 插件绝对路径。
  - **插件结构错误** — 旧安装器为每个 skill 创建独立的 marketplace 插件目录（9 个插件 × 9 个 enabledPlugins 键）。现在部署为单个 `spec-superflow` 插件，包含 `skills/` 子目录、`.codebuddy-plugin/plugin.json` 清单、`rules/phase-guard.md` 规则，settings.json 中仅需 `spec-superflow@cb_teams_marketplace` 单个启用键。旧安装产生的 per-skill 键会在升级时自动清理。

### Added

- WorkBuddy 安装器新增 `--dry-run` 预览模式和 `--tag` 指定版本安装。
- WorkBuddy 平台现在有 phase-guard 规则（`rules/phase-guard.md`，WorkBuddy 自动加载为常驻上下文）。

## [0.8.13] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- **跨平台安装支持扩展至 17 个平台** — 新增 8 个 AI 编程平台的一键安装器，平台覆盖面对齐 comet：
  - `ssf install-cline` — Cline（`.cline/skills/` + `.clinerules/phase-guard.md`）
  - `ssf install-kiro` — Kiro（`.kiro/skills/` + `.kiro/steering/phase-guard.md`）
  - `ssf install-windsurf` — Windsurf（`.windsurf/skills/` + `.windsurf/rules/phase-guard.md`）
  - `ssf install-qwen` — Qwen Code（`.qwen/skills/` + `.qwen/rules/phase-guard.md`）
  - `ssf install-amazon-q` — Amazon Q Developer（`.amazonq/skills/` + `.amazonq/rules/phase-guard.md`）
  - `ssf install-roocode` — Roo Code（`.roo/skills/` + `.roo/rules/phase-guard.md`）
  - `ssf install-continue` — Continue（`.continue/skills/` + `.continue/rules/phase-guard.md`）
  - `ssf install-pi` — Pi（`.pi/skills/`，无规则目录，手动 `/workflow-start`）
- **共享安装器架构** — 新增 `scripts/lib/platforms.mjs`（平台注册表）与 `scripts/lib/install.mjs`（共享安装器），8 个 `install-<id>.mjs` 为薄壳调用，路径全部与 comet `src/core/platforms.ts` 交叉核实。`install-cursor.mjs` / `install-workbuddy` 保持原样。
- **平台支持矩阵文档** — 新增 `docs/platform-matrix.md`，17 平台 × Skills/Rules/Hooks 三层接入透明化。
- **CLI 命令** — `ssf` 注册 8 个 `install-<id>` 子命令，`npx spec-superflow@latest install-<id>` 一键部署。

### Changed

- INSTALL.md 平台总览表从 9 行扩至 17 行，新增 8 个平台完整安装/升级/卸载/验证章节。
- README.md 安装区表格与 CLI 命令表同步扩充。

### Notes

- Kiro / Windsurf / Qwen / Amazon Q 原生支持 hooks，但 spec-superflow 的 SessionStart 钩子在这些平台的可用性未逐一验证，v0.8.13 暂不写入 hook 配置；上下文注入由 phase-guard 规则（平台自动加载）承担，后续版本验证后补齐。
- 剩余 14 个 comet 平台（Junie / Bob / ForgeCode / Crush / iFlow / CoStrict / Factory / KiloCode / Auggie / Lingma / KimiCode / Antigravity ×2 等）留待 v0.8.14+ 分批跟进。

## [0.8.12] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- **Workflow mode inference** — hotfix/tweak auto-detection now recognizes common non-JavaScript source files, including Java, Go, Python, Rust, Kotlin, Swift, C/C++, C#, Ruby, PHP, and shell scripts, so multi-task code changes are no longer misclassified as config/doc-only tweaks.

## [0.8.11] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- **DP-0 audit consistency** — `ssf audit` now treats existing `dp_0_confirmed: true` state as a recorded DP-0 confirmation, and `dp_0_result` is now persisted by the state loader instead of being dropped after `ssf state set`.

## [0.8.10] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- **Guard fast-path gating** — `exploring -> bridging` now requires `hotfix` or `tweak`, and `exploring -> approved-for-build` now requires `tweak`; `full`/`auto` workflows no longer skip `contract-builder` and approval gates.
- **State transition safety** — `ssf state transition` now fails closed when guard execution fails, returns malformed output, reports non-boolean `pass`, or exits unsuccessfully, preventing state writes after unreliable guard checks.
- **Execution branch isolation** — `build-executor` now requires branch/worktree preflight before implementation and stops for explicit approval before editing `main` or `master`.

## [0.8.9] - 2026-07-04

### Added

- **WorkBuddy installer** — New `ssf install-workbuddy` command deploys all 9 skills into WorkBuddy's marketplace plugin directory and enables them in `~/.workbuddy/settings.json`.
- **WorkBuddy installer tests** — Covers target path planning, skill copy behavior, settings preservation, and package-root resolution for `npx` usage.

### Changed

- **Installation docs** — Updated README, English README, INSTALL.md, OpenCode notes, AGENTS.md, and llms.txt to reflect current mainstream installation paths for Claude Code, Cursor, OpenAI Codex CLI/App, GitHub Copilot CLI, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, WorkBuddy, and Trae.
- **Update guidance** — Added WorkBuddy upgrade command to the version reminder output.

### Fixed

- **Doctor manifest coverage** — `ssf doctor` now checks `.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json` and `.github/plugin/marketplace.json`, and correctly handles multiple version fields in the same manifest file.

## [0.8.8] - 2026-07-03

### Changed

- **Token efficiency optimization**: Compressed all prompt injection surfaces by 60.3% (from ~24,387 estimated tokens to ~9,669).
  - `hooks/session-start`: 23→15 lines, comments compressed, platform branches share message variable.
  - 9 skill SKILL.md files: 2,461→750 lines total (−69.5%). Each skill ≤250 lines, 0 token lint issues.
  - Phase guard files (`.claude/always/phase-guard.md`, `GEMINI.md`): 14→3 lines each, reference state machine instead of enumerating operations.
  - `workflow-start` initialization simplified: deferred non-critical checks to target skills.

### Added

- **Token baseline tool** (`scripts/token-baseline.mjs`): Measures lines, characters, and estimated tokens for all injection components. Supports `--compare` for pre/post compression analysis.
- **Token lint rules** (`scripts/lint/rules/token-rules.mjs`): 4 rules — max lines, max chars, emphasis marker limits, code block length limits. Banned markers: `EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT`, `CRITICAL`.
- **`--include token`** support in `lint-skills.mjs` for token-specific linting.
- **CI token lint step**: Warning-only check in both build-and-test and release jobs.
- **Phase guard files** now included in version consistency checks.

## [0.8.7] - 2026-07-03

### Added

- **Skill lint framework**: `scripts/lint/lint-skills.mjs` with 5 rules for static analysis of skill instruction quality.
- **Guard transition tests**: 43 regression tests covering all 21 legal transitions and 8 illegal rejections.
- **Exception handling**: All 9 skills now include guidance for parse failures, missing files, and user interruption recovery.

### Fixed (Bug)

- **Parser bilingual support**: `parseChangeMarkdown` now correctly extracts sections from bilingual headings (e.g., `## 背景（Why）`). Previously it used English-only exact matching, silently returning empty strings.
- **Guard workflow normalization**: `ssf state transition` no longer silently skips guard checks when workflow is `auto`. The `auto` mode is now normalized to `full` before guard invocation.
- **Guard error handling**: Terminal states (`abandoned`, `closing`) now correctly reject further transitions instead of allowing them through.

### Changed

- **build-executor**: Added DP-4 and DP-5 record commands.
- **contract-builder**: Added DP-3 record command and exception handling guidance.
- **release-archivist**: Added DP-6/DP-7 record commands and DP gap detection.
- **workflow-start**: Fixed "Route to abandonment" → "Route to abandoned state".
- All 9 skills: Added standardized exception handling sections.

## [0.8.6] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed (Bug)

- **CI**: Correct `actions/setup-node` SHA — the previously pinned `v4.5.0` release didn't exist. Changed to `v4.4.0` (latest actual v4). This was silently breaking all CI runs on main.

### Changed

- **Deps**: Bump `actions/checkout` from 4.2.2 to 7.0.0 (SHA-pinned, `tsc` verified).
- **Deps**: Bump `typescript` from 5.9.3 to 6.0.3 (devDependency, `tsc --noEmit` zero errors).
- **Branch protection**: Main branch now requires PR + CI checks (`Build & Test (22)`, `scan`) before merge.

## [0.8.5] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed (Bug)

- **Issue #9**: Cursor installation (`install-cursor.mjs`) now copies the full runtime tree (`scripts/`, `docs/`, `templates/`, `dist/`, `hooks/`) instead of just `skills/`. Fixes 24 broken `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` references in skills.

### Added

- **`ssf install-cursor` CLI command**: Deploys spec-superflow to `.cursor/` directory.
- **Multi-platform marketplace support**:
  - `.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json` — Cursor marketplace submission
  - `.opencode/plugins/spec-superflow.js` — OpenCode plugin entry
  - `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` — `composerIcon` for Codex
  - `gemini-extension.json` — Gemini CLI verified install
- **Codex scanner**: `SECURITY.md`, `assets/icon.svg`, `.codexignore`, `.github/dependabot.yml`, `hol-plugin-scanner.yml` CI workflow. Scanner score: 92/130.
- **Branch protection setup** for main branch.

### Changed

- **README**: Restructured with quick start first. English README fully synced with Chinese version.

## [0.8.4] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed (Bug)

- **Critical: C-1** — Validator bilingual heading support: `extractSection` regex now matches both `## Why` and `## 背景（Why）` style headings. Chinese templates no longer fail schema validation.
- **Critical: C-2** — Guard dead transition `bridging:approved` fixed to `bridging:approved-for-build` (matching canonical state name).
- **Critical: C-3** — Cursor workflow-orchestrator guard call fixed to use `approved-for-build` instead of `approved`, preventing "Unknown transition" errors.
- **High: H-1** — Guard transition matrix extended with 6 missing rewind transitions (`specifying:exploring`, `bridging:specifying`, `approved-for-build:bridging`, `executing:specifying`, `executing:bridging`, `closing:specifying`).
- **High: H-2** — `ssf state transition` now runs guard checks before writing state. Guard is no longer bypassable via direct CLI.
- **High: H-3** — `tasks-complete.mjs` now matches both `[x]` and `[X]` (case-insensitive) and supports indented/nested tasks (`[ \t]*` prefix).
- **High: H-4** — `build-executor` SKILL.md: 3 script paths fixed to use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` prefix, preventing breakage after worktree `cd`.
- **High: H-5** — `spec-merger` SKILL.md: removed non-existent `workflow/` path prefix from 7 spec locations.
- **High: H-6** — `infer-workflow.mjs`: fixed `import.meta.url` comparison for relative-path invocation (added `import.meta.filename` fallback for Node 22+).
- **High: H-7** — `cmd-state.mjs` transition now validates state names against `VALID_STATES` whitelist, rejecting typos that corrupt the state machine.
- **Medium: M-1** — 6 skill H1 titles updated from v0.7 old names to v0.8.x current names (e.g., "Spec Explorer" → "Need Explorer").
- **Medium: M-2** — `state-loader.mjs`: `||` replaced with `??` across 10 fields, preventing empty string → null data loss.
- **Medium: M-3** — `hash.mjs`: specs hash now only includes `spec.md` files (not all `.md` files), preventing false hash mismatch from README.md changes.
- **Medium: M-4** — `schema-valid.mjs`: WARNING-level issues now captured and returned alongside ERRORs instead of being silently discarded.
- **Medium: M-6** — `schema-valid.mjs`: dynamic `import()` now wrapped in try/catch with helpful "Run 'npm run build'" error message.
- **Medium: M-7** — `infer-workflow.mjs`: explicit `workflow: full` no longer overridden by auto-detection heuristic.
- **Medium: M-8** — `workflow-start` SKILL.md: 8 relative script paths fixed to use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` prefix.
- **Medium: M-9** — `cmd-state.mjs` SETTABLE_FIELDS extended with 25 missing fields (`batches_completed`, `dp_0_result`, `dp_N_decisions`, `dp_N_confirmed` for DP-1 through DP-7).
- **Medium: M-10** — `bug-investigator` SKILL.md: added DP-5 (调试升级) reference near 3+ failure escalation rule.
- **Low: L-1** — `CLAUDE.md` ASCII state diagram: `approved` → `approved-for-build`.
- **Low: L-2** — `spec-superflow.mjs` CLI help: example uses `approved-for-build` instead of `approved`.
- **Low: L-3** — `cmd-state.mjs` get: blocks prototype property reads (`__proto__`, `constructor`, etc.).
- **Low: L-4** — `cmd-state.mjs` init: auto-creates change directory if missing.
- **Low: L-7** — `docs/state-machine.md`: added fast-path transitions (`exploring→bridging`, `exploring→approved-for-build`).

### Changed (Token Optimization)

- **T-1** — `session-start` hook injection reduced from ~100 tokens to ~40 tokens (~60% reduction). Removed `set -euo pipefail` and no-op `| cat` pipes.
- **T-2** — `install-cursor.mjs`: now cleans old skill directories before copying, preventing stale v0.7 names from accumulating.
- **T-3** — `cmd-inject.mjs`: `claude` platform writer no longer writes duplicate `rules/phase-guard.md` (`.claude/always/phase-guard.md` suffices).
- **T-4** — `.cursor/skills/`: removed 8 stale v0.7 skill directories (spec-explorer, spec-forger, spec-syncer, bridge-contract, execution-governor, systematic-debugger, closure-archivist, workflow-orchestrator). Now has only 9 current skills.
- **T-5** — Deleted stale `rules/phase-guard.md` file.

### Changed (Internal)

- `package.json` test script now runs all 152 tests (e2e + lib), not just e2e.
- Guard test updated for `bridging→approved-for-build` transition name.

## [0.8.3] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- **130 new tests** — CLI scripts (`cmd-list`, `cmd-state`, `cmd-audit`, `cmd-doctor`, `cmd-inject`) and guard system now have comprehensive test coverage. 152 total tests (up from 22), covering config loading, state management, hash computation, guard transitions, workflow inference, and phase guard generation.

### Fixed

- **`infer-workflow` empty directory** — previously returned `hotfix` for empty change directories (0 tasks, 0 files); now correctly returns `full` as the safe default.

### Changed

- **Refactored guard run loop** — switch-case replaced with `CHECK_RUNNERS` lookup map for cleaner dimension dispatch.
- **Deduplicated `cmd-validate`** — `design.md` and `tasks.md` structural validation merged into a single config-driven loop.
- **Exported internal functions** — `detectChangeStatus` (cmd-list), `generateReport`/`DP_NAMES` (cmd-audit), 7 doctor check functions (cmd-doctor), `generatePhaseGuard`/`toCursorMdc`/`toCopilotInstructions` (cmd-inject) now exported for direct unit testing.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- **DP-1 and DP-2 implementation** — `need-explorer` now records DP-1 (requirement confirmation) before handing off to `spec-writer`; `spec-writer` now records DP-2 (artifact review) before handing off to `contract-builder`.

### Fixed

- **SessionStart token overhead (issue #5)** — `hooks/session-start` now injects a ~50 token lightweight pointer instead of the full 360-line `workflow-start` SKILL.md, reducing per-session context-window usage by ~2,200 words.
- **tweak fast-path deadlock** — `guard.mjs` now skips `artifacts-exist` checks for tweak workflow, and `build-executor` accepts tweak mode without requiring `execution-contract.md`. The advertised tweak path now actually works.
- **State name inconsistency** — `approved` and `approved-for-build` standardized to `approved-for-build` across `guard.mjs`, `cmd-inject.mjs`, `workflow-start`, and `state-machine.md`. Removed duplicate `approved` phase-guard template.
- **`ssf list` false CLOSED** — `detectChangeStatus` now reads `.spec-superflow.yaml` state instead of inferring closure from file existence. Previously reported BRIDGED changes as CLOSED.
- **`ssf audit` missing DP-0** — DP-0 (user confirmation gate) now included in audit reports alongside DP-1–DP-7.
- **Guard `artifacts-exist` config-aware** — now respects `artifacts.skip` from `spec-superflow.config.json`, allowing projects to exclude optional planning artifacts.
- **Old skill names in guard scripts** — `contract-fresh.mjs` and `tests-passing.mjs` error messages updated to reference `contract-builder` and `release-archivist`.
- **Sub-prompt path resolution** — `build-executor` and `code-reviewer` now use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/<name>/` paths for sub-prompt templates instead of bare filenames.
- **`ssf validate` coverage** — now validates all 4 planning artifacts (`design.md` and `tasks.md` basic structural checks added).
- **Config default artifact order** — `execution-contract` removed from `artifacts.order` default (it's `contract-builder`'s output, not `spec-writer`'s).
- **README state count** — corrected from 7 to 8 states (includes `abandoned`).

### Changed

- **README "不推荐使用" refreshed** — v0.8.x improvements (hotfix, tweak, Batch Inline, reduced token overhead) now cover many previously-excluded scenarios. The "not recommended" section now only lists truly unsuitable cases (throwaway scripts, pure Q&A).

## [0.8.1] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- **Auto-latest Cursor install** — `scripts/install-cursor.mjs` now downloads and deploys the latest GitHub release by default. Use `--local <path>` to deploy from a local repo.
- **Update check reminder** — New `scripts/check-update.mjs` compares the installed version with npm latest. `workflow-start` runs it on startup and surfaces a non-blocking upgrade reminder when behind.

### Changed

- **INSTALL.md** now documents `/plugin update spec-superflow@spec-superflow` as the Claude Code upgrade path and provides a curl one-liner for Cursor auto-deployment.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- **Intuitive skill names** — All 9 skills renamed to action-object style: `workflow-start`, `need-explorer`, `spec-writer`, `contract-builder`, `build-executor`, `bug-investigator`, `code-reviewer`, `release-archivist`, `spec-merger`.
- **Batch Inline execution mode** — `build-executor` now supports `Batch Inline` for low-risk, same-module tasks, reducing subagent dispatch overhead for small changes like issue #5.
- **User confirmation gate (DP-0)** — `workflow-start` confirms key decisions with the user before routing to `spec-writer`; `spec-writer` honors confirmed constraints and pauses on unconfirmed decisions.
- **Migration guide** — Added `docs/skill-rename-v0.8.0.md` with old→new mapping and per-platform refresh instructions.

### Changed

- **Documentation sync** — `README.md`, `INSTALL.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/state-machine.md`, `docs/decision-points.md`, `GEMINI.md`, main `specs/`, `templates/`, and plugin manifests updated to use the new skill names and v0.8.0 install instructions.
- **Version sync** — `ssf version` now also updates `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`; `ssf doctor` checks all 7 manifests.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed

- **README consistency** — 移除架构图中不存在的 `schemas/` 目录，补充 `scripts/guard/`、`install-cursor.mjs`、`infer-workflow.mjs`；明确 Cursor 的 session-start hook 需要手动复制到 `.cursor/hooks.json`。

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- **Multi-platform phase-guard injection** — `ssf inject` now generates phase-guard artifacts for Claude Code (`.claude/always/phase-guard.md`), Cursor (`.cursor/rules/phase-guard.mdc`), Copilot (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`), and Gemini (`GEMINI.md`). New `--platforms` flag limits output to a subset.
- **Auto workflow-mode detection** — `workflow-orchestrator` infers `hotfix`/`tweak`/`full` from artifact content when `.spec-superflow.yaml` workflow is `auto`. Added `scripts/infer-workflow.mjs` helper. Explicit workflow values are preserved.
- **Decision-point audit report** — New `ssf audit <change-dir>` command reads `.spec-superflow.yaml` DP fields and generates `decision-point-audit.md` with a summary table and per-DP interpretation.
- **Cursor local deploy** — New `scripts/install-cursor.mjs` copies skills to `.cursor/skills/` and creates `.cursor/rules/phase-guard.mdc` for Cursor Agent.
- **Template localization** — All planning templates under `templates/` are now in Chinese while keeping required parsing markers intact.

### Fixed

- **Copilot CLI plugin manifest** — Root `plugin.json` `author` is now an object (`{ "name": "..." }`) to satisfy Copilot CLI strict validation.
- **`ssf doctor` author check** — Added validation for root `plugin.json` `author` format.
- **INSTALL.md accuracy** — Cursor and Copilot CLI install instructions now describe the actual working mechanisms.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- **Fast-path workflow modes** — hotfix and tweak modes skip full planning for small changes. Hotfix: ≤2 files, no new modules, minimal contract. Tweak: ≤4 files, config/doc only, direct edit. Auto-upgrade to full when thresholds exceeded.
- **Phase-drift prevention** — `ssf inject` command generates `rules/phase-guard.md` and installs to `.claude/always/` for per-turn Agent context injection. 9 state templates with allowed/forbidden operations. Forms a soft+hard dual defense with guard.mjs.
- **Decision point protocol** — `docs/decision-points.md` defines 7 standard decision points (DP-1 through DP-7) with triggers, inputs, outputs, and associated skills. All 4 affected skills reference DP numbers.
- **Guard mode awareness** — `guard.mjs` accepts `--workflow` parameter (full/hotfix/tweak) for mode-specific check skipping. 2 new transitions: `exploring→bridging`, `exploring→approved`.
- **State set command** — `ssf state set <dir> <field> <value>` with SETTABLE_FIELDS whitelist. 14 new decision point audit fields (dp_N_result + dp_N_timestamp).

### Changed

- **Guard schema-valid** — Uses `validateDeltaSpec` for change specs, fixing a format mismatch between delta spec and main spec validators.
- **4 skill files** — workflow-orchestrator (mode detection + fast-path routing + DP refs), bridge-contract (hotfix minimal contract), execution-governor (tweak direct edit), closure-archivist (lightweight closure).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- **Guard script system** — `scripts/guard/guard.mjs` provides dimension-based phase transition validation with 5 check dimensions. Exit code ≠ 0 blocks transitions. Reuses existing Validator engine for schema validation.
  - `artifacts-exist` — checks all 4 planning artifacts + specs/ are present and non-empty
  - `schema-valid` — validates proposal.md and all specs/*/spec.md using the Validator engine
  - `contract-fresh` — compares stored artifacts hash against current artifacts for staleness detection
  - `tasks-complete` — verifies all tasks.md items are checked off
  - `tests-passing` — confirms test_result: pass is recorded in state file
- **Lightweight state file** — `.spec-superflow.yaml` as a derived cache (12 fields) for fast context recovery. Always rebuildable from artifacts via `ssf state rebuild`. Artifacts are the source of truth; state file is a performance optimization.
- **SHA256 hash acceleration** — `scripts/lib/hash.mjs` computes artifact hashes for O(1) staleness detection. Reduces staleness detection from ~3500 tokens (full content read) to ~50 tokens (single script call).
- **ssf state CLI** — New `state` subcommand with 5 operations: `init`, `check`, `transition`, `get`, `rebuild`.

### Changed

- **workflow-orchestrator** — Each routing rule now includes a guard script invocation step before allowing transitions.
- **bridge-contract** — Automatically runs `ssf state init` after contract generation.
- **closure-archivist** — Runs `ssf state transition` after verification completes.
- **execution-governor** — Updates `batches_completed` in state file after each batch.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- **CLI toolchain** — `ssf` command with 6 subcommands: `list` (scan changes and report status), `validate` (artifact validation via Validator), `doctor` (health check: version sync, hooks, skills, dist, node, docs, config), `version` (one-command version sync to all manifests), `sync` (delta spec merge with conflict detection), `config` (display/modify configuration). Zero dependencies via `node:util.parseArgs`.
- **Configuration system** — Optional `spec-superflow.config.json` for customizing artifact order, skip list, execution thresholds, and verification language. Absence = v0.3.0 defaults. Deep-merge with built-in defaults. Skills query config at runtime via `scripts/get-config` bash helper.
- **Multi-language tokenizer** — `src/validation/tokenizer.ts` with English stemmer (extracted from validator) + Chinese CJK tokenizer (Unicode ranges + 2-5 char sliding window + stop words). Auto-detection based on CJK character ratio. Mixed mode runs both tokenizers and unions results.
- **Conflict detection** — `Validator.detectSyncConflicts()` detects when multiple changes modify the same requirement across unsynced delta specs. Integrated into `ssf sync` command and `spec-syncer` skill pre-flight check.
- **git worktree isolation** — execution-governor now recommends worktree creation when executing on main/master branch. Pure SKILL.md guidance, no code changes.

### Changed

- **package.json** — Added `bin` field exposing `ssf` and `spec-superflow` commands.
- **validateImplementation()** — Refactored to use `tokenize()` instead of inline `stem()`. Added optional `config` parameter for language override (`'auto' | 'en' | 'zh'`). Backward compatible — existing callers work unchanged.
- **Tokenizer refinements** — CJK sliding window extended to 2-5 chars (covers compound words like "令牌桶算法"). English min token length lowered to 3 (preserves short tokens like "jwt"). Added "based"/"using"/"used" to English stop words.
- **Version manifests** — `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` and `gemini-extension.json` now tracked in version sync (previously lagging at 0.2.0 and 0.1.0).

### Fixed

- **Version consistency** — `ssf version` command ensures all 5 manifest files stay in sync. `ssf doctor` reports inconsistencies as warnings.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- **Inline execution mode** — Lightweight single-session execution for small changes (≤ 3 tasks, no cross-module dependencies). Parallel to SDD subagent mode. Preserves TDD Iron Law with checkpoint review per task. Automatic mode selection with user override.
- **Abandoned terminal state** — 8th workflow state allowing graceful change abandonment from any non-terminal state. Generates `abandonment-summary.md` with reason, lessons learned, and recommendations. Blocks delta spec merge for abandoned changes. Partial code preservation supported.
- **Three-dimensional verification** — closure-archivist now verifies Completeness (all tasks/requirements implemented), Correctness (tests pass, no placeholders), and Coherence (design decisions reflected in code). New `Validator.validateImplementation()` API with word-stemming and keyword matching.
- **abandonment-summary.md template** — Structured template for documenting abandoned changes.
- **Verification types** — New exports: `VerificationDimension`, `VerificationStatus`, `VerificationFinding`, `VerificationReport`.

### Changed

- **spec-forger task planning** — Rewritten with writing-plans methodology: File Structure section, Interfaces block (Consumes/Produces), per-task TDD expansion (5 phases), exact file paths with line ranges, zero placeholder enforcement, 2-5 minute granularity per step.
- **execution-contract.md template** — Added Execution Mode (SDD | Inline) selection field and Verification Dimensions table.
- **tasks.md template** — Added File Structure and Interfaces sections for cross-batch dependency tracking.
- **State machine** — Extended from 7 to 8 states (+abandoned terminal state). Universal abandoned transition from any non-terminal state.
- **Validator engine** — New `validateImplementation(diffSummary, specContent, designContent)` method with three-dimensional `VerificationReport` return type. Word-stemming for Completeness matching, keyword-based Coherence checking.
- **closure-archivist** — Verification steps expanded from 3 to 5 (Correctness, Completeness, Coherence, Unintended Scope Detection, Verification Report). Structured output with PASS/CONDITIONAL/FAIL verdict.
- **spec-syncer** — Pre-flight guard blocks sync for abandoned changes.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- **hooks.json format** — Changed from incorrect array format to Claude Code plugin record format. Event name corrected from `Startup|Clear|Compact` to standard `SessionStart`. Command path now uses `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` environment variable for cross-platform compatibility.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- **Engine layer (`src/`)** — embedded OpenSpec schema/validation/parsing engine in TypeScript
  - `src/schema/` — Requirement, Delta (ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED/RENAMED), Spec, Change type definitions
  - `src/validation/` — Validator class with validateSpecContent, validateChangeContent, validateDeltaSpec
  - `src/parsing/` — Requirement block parser + Delta spec parser (self-contained, no external deps)
- **3 new skills** (6 → 9 total):
  - `systematic-debugger` — 4-phase root cause debugging (Root Cause → Pattern → Hypothesis → Implementation)
  - `code-reviewer` — Unified code review (request + receive), 3 severity levels (Critical/Important/Minor)
  - `spec-syncer` — Delta Spec → Main Spec intelligent merge with conflict detection
- **SDD (Subagent-Driven Development)** — Full implementation discipline embedded in `execution-governor`:
  - `implementer-prompt.md` — Subagent implementation template with TDD evidence + self-review
  - `task-reviewer-prompt.md` — Dual-verdict review (spec compliance + code quality)
  - `code-reviewer-prompt.md` — Structured code review template
- **Helper scripts (`scripts/`)** — `task-brief`, `review-package`, `validate-artifacts`
- **Session-start hooks (`hooks/`)** — Multi-platform bootstrap (Claude Code / Cursor / Copilot CLI)
- **Content-level stale detection** — `workflow-orchestrator` now compares proposal scope vs contract intent lock

### Changed

- State machine extended from 6 to 7 states (+`debugging`)
- All 6 existing skills enhanced with embedded engine capabilities:
  - `spec-explorer` — embedded brainstorming's "one question at a time + 2-3 approach comparison"
  - `spec-forger` — Schema engine validation on every artifact + writing-plans task granularity
  - `bridge-contract` — parsing engine auto-extraction of contract fields
  - `execution-governor` — Full TDD Iron Law + SDD workflow + Review Gates
  - `closure-archivist` — verification-before-completion Iron Law
  - `workflow-orchestrator` — content-level inspection + 3 new routing targets
- Plugin metadata updated to v0.2.0 with expanded keywords across all manifest files

### Release Quality

- **TypeScript compilation** — Added `tsconfig.json` (ES2022, NodeNext, strict mode), `npm run build` produces `dist/` with declarations
- **Integration tests** — 8 test cases using real example artifacts (`docs/examples/`), `npm test` passes
- **package.json** — `main` points to `dist/index.js`, `types` to `dist/index.d.ts`
- **Documentation** — Updated English README Current Status to v0.2.0

### Notes

- First release targets Claude Code and Trae style local skill loading
- Runtime ownership remains inside `spec-superflow`
- OpenSpec and Superpowers are reference influences, not runtime dependencies
