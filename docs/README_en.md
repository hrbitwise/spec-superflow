## Quick Start

Once installed, just tell your agent:

```
use workflow-start to begin
```

The agent inspects your current artifacts, performs **content-level detection** (comparing proposal scope vs. contract intent lock, not just file timestamps), determines your workflow stage, and routes to the correct next skill.

- New change → `use workflow-start to begin`
- Resume work → `continue the workflow`
- Unsure → `check what state we're in`

## Installation

### Claude Code (Marketplace)

Claude Code's primary installation path is the plugin marketplace:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add hrbitwise/spec-superflow
/plugin install spec-superflow@spec-superflow
/plugin update spec-superflow@spec-superflow   # upgrade
```

### Cursor (Skills directories / GitHub import)

```bash
npx spec-superflow@latest install-cursor

# Or run the installer directly:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hrbitwise/spec-superflow/main/scripts/install-cursor.mjs | node -
```

Cursor discovers `.cursor/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`, `~/.cursor/skills/`, and compatible Claude/Codex skill directories. You can also import a GitHub repo from Customize → Rules → Remote Rule (Github).

### OpenAI Codex CLI / App

Codex uses the Plugin Directory / marketplace model. This repo ships `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` and `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`.

```bash
codex
/plugins

# Or add the community marketplace and install:
codex plugin marketplace add hashgraph-online/awesome-codex-plugins
codex plugin add spec-superflow@spec-superflow
```

In the Codex app, open **Plugins** and install or enable `spec-superflow`. If installed from the CLI, restart the app and enable it in the Plugins panel.

> Codex loads the plugin's declared skills, but this plugin does not enable SessionStart hooks; invoke `workflow-start` explicitly in each new session.

### GitHub Copilot CLI

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace add hrbitwise/spec-superflow
copilot plugin install spec-superflow@spec-superflow
```

### Gemini CLI

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/hrbitwise/spec-superflow
gemini extensions update spec-superflow   # upgrade
```

### CLI Toolchain

```bash
npm install -g spec-superflow
```

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `ssf list` | List all changes and status |
| `ssf validate <dir>` | Validate artifact completeness |
| `ssf doctor` | Health check (versions, hooks, skills, docs) |
| `ssf version <semver>` | Sync version across all manifests |
| `ssf state <sub> <dir>` | Manage `.spec-superflow.yaml` state file |
| `ssf inject <dir>` | Generate phase-guard artifacts; omit `--platforms` only when exactly one platform marker is detected |
| `ssf audit <dir>` | Generate decision-point audit report |
| `ssf checkpoint save <dir> --task <id> --next <text>` | Save a task-level recovery checkpoint |
| `ssf checkpoint list <dir>` | List checkpoints and stale status |
| `ssf checkpoint show <dir> <id>` | Show one recovery checkpoint |
| `ssf resume [change]` | Read-only recovery summary; auto-selects the only active change |
| `ssf switch <change>` | Read-only recovery context for an explicit change; an adapter may use it to focus the current AI conversation |
| `ssf save <change> --task <id> --next <text>` | Manually reuses the existing checkpoint protocol; never commits, pushes, or syncs automatically |
| `ssf handoff create <dir> --type <type> ...` | Create a prototype/research/experiment handoff |
| `ssf handoff list <dir>` | List handoff lifecycle status |
| `ssf handoff finish <dir> <id>` | Validate a handoff result |
| `ssf handoff resolve <dir> <id> --decision <decision>` | Record an explicit handoff decision |
| `ssf isolate <dir>` | Enforce git isolation before implementation: creates a worktree (with recursive submodule init) or branch when on main/master, and appends a cwd-persistence warning to the progress ledger |
| `ssf finish <dir> [--test-cmd <command>]` | One-command close-out: merge --no-ff back to the trunk, verify sync, run a verification command on the trunk (default `npm test`, 10-minute timeout), and remove the worktree and isolation branch only after verification passes; on failure the worktree is kept for rework |
| `ssf install-cursor` | Deploy to `.cursor/` directory |
| `ssf install-workbuddy` | Deploy to WorkBuddy marketplace and enable skills |
| `ssf install-codebuddy` | Deploy to `~/.codebuddy/` (CodeBuddy Code CLI) |
| `ssf uninstall-codebuddy` | Remove spec-superflow from `~/.codebuddy/` (CodeBuddy Code CLI) |
| `ssf install-trae` | Deploy to Trae `~/.trae/skills/` (or `~/.trae-cn/skills/`) + `user_rules/` |
| `ssf install-zcode` | Deploy to ZCODE `.zcode/skills/` + `.zcode/rules/` |

> **CodeBuddy install & PATH**: `npx spec-superflow@latest install-codebuddy` works without a global install — the installer deploys skills/rules/hooks into `~/.codebuddy/` and generates a `ssf` command shim under `~/.codebuddy/spec-superflow/bin/` (`ssf.cmd`/`ssf.ps1` on Windows). By default it registers the bin dir on the user PATH (user-level environment variable on Windows, shell rc file on POSIX), so a new terminal can call `ssf` directly; `--no-path` skips the PATH change (shims are still written), and `--dry-run` only prints the plan without touching the disk.

### Version

- Current: `v1.4.0`
- v1.0: Quick, direct Hotfix, Tweak, and Full paths keep small changes bounded while reserving planning, contracts, and reviews for complex work.
- Self-contained — no OpenSpec or Superpowers runtime required
- Upstream: [Fission-AI/OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec), [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)
- Changelog: [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md)

`ssf inject` examples:

```bash
ssf inject changes/my-change --platforms cursor
ssf inject changes/my-change --platforms all
```

If `--platforms` is omitted, injection only proceeds when exactly one project marker is detected. Ambiguous projects must use `--platforms <platform>` or `--platforms all`.

Session recovery and optional prototypes:

```bash
ssf resume                         # auto-select only when exactly one change is active
ssf resume changes/my-change       # read-only summary for one explicit change
ssf switch changes/another-change  # read-only recovery context for one explicit change
ssf save changes/my-change --task 1.1 --next "Run focused tests"
ssf checkpoint save changes/my-change --task 1.1 --next "Run focused tests"
ssf checkpoint list changes/my-change
ssf handoff create changes/my-change --type research --objective "Compare approaches" --expected-output "Recommendation" --acceptance "Evidence recorded"
```

`resume` and `switch` are read-only recovery operations; `resume` auto-selects a target only when exactly one active change exists. `switch` only returns the explicit target's recovery context and never changes cwd, a TUI session, or a hidden pointer; the CLI itself does not mutate conversation focus, while a CodeBuddy/WorkBuddy adapter or host agent may use that context to focus the conversation. `save` only manually reuses the existing checkpoint protocol; it never commits, pushes, or syncs automatically. `/ssf:resume`, `/ssf:switch`, and `/ssf:save` are Markdown command adapters for CodeBuddy/WorkBuddy that dispatch to the same CLI guards; other platforms are not promised identical slash names.

Prototype work starts only after explicit user confirmation. Backend, CLI,
configuration, and internal-refactor work does not enter the prototype route
automatically. Handoff results never edit `design.md` or `tasks.md` automatically.

Canonical delta specs live at `specs/<capability>/spec.md`; flat `specs/<capability>.md` and root-level `specs/spec.md` are not valid canonical paths.

The canonical requirement heading is `### Requirement: name`. For existing Chinese artifacts, the parser also accepts `### 需求：name` and `### REQ-<ID>: name`; other level-three headings are not requirements. `ssf sync` validates every delta before publishing the batch, so an invalid delta never writes a baseline or publication receipt.

### Active specs and published baselines

An active workflow has one source of truth: `changes/<change>/`, whose `specs/` directory contains auditable delta specs. Root `specs/` is the published specification baseline and never drives active change transitions. `ssf sync changes/<change>` applies ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED/RENAMED operations to the baseline's `## Requirements` and writes a recomputable publication receipt to the change state. Closing verifies both the delta and baseline; editing either after sync requires another sync, and `spec_merged: true` cannot bypass this check.

### Plugin repository versus consuming project

This repository ships the workflow, templates, scripts, tests, and documentation; it does not ship the runtime output of one real change. It therefore does not commit `changes/<change>/`, `.spec-superflow.yaml`, `.superpowers/`, or root `specs/` generated by `ssf sync`; those paths are ignored by default. End-to-end examples belong in curated, sanitized `docs/examples/` fixtures.

In a **project that uses this plugin**, `changes/<change>/specs/` remains the active input and root `specs/` remains an optional published baseline. That project may choose whether to version its own artifacts for audit or release purposes, without changing the rule that active workflow transitions read only the change.

## Why

AI coding sessions commonly fail in two ways:

- **The AI starts coding before you've decided what to build.** You say "add authorization" and it touches 40 files before you realize — RBAC or ABAC?

- **The plan is solid, but execution drifts.** The proposal, specs, and design are written, but nobody enforces testing, nobody gates reviews, and by merge time the behavior doesn't match.

spec-superflow handles these cases differently: it first assesses change risk; small changes stay within a clear boundary and verification step, while complex changes use intent, specs, an execution contract, implementation, and review. This keeps routine work short without skipping the checks that matter for risky work.

| Principle | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Choose the path first | Select Quick, Hotfix, Tweak, or Full from scope and risk |
| Align complex work | Full uses specs and an execution contract to agree scope and acceptance |
| Verify implementation | Every path requires tests or checks proportionate to risk |
| Diagnose before changing | Reproduce and locate failures before attempting a fix |
| Self-contained | No OpenSpec or Superpowers runtime is required |

### When to Use

**✅ Recommended:** Large features, multi-person collaboration, long-term maintenance, brownfield projects needing TDD + review gates.

**❌ Skip:** One-off scripts, pure Q&A conversations.

> **Four workflow modes:** Quick (≤3 low-risk code files/tasks), direct Hotfix (incident, ≤2), and Tweak (≤4 config/docs files) execute with bounded verification; Full and legacy Hotfix retain planning, contract, and review controls.

---

## Comparison with Similar Approaches

AI coding workflow tools layer by which risk they control: requirement clarity, spec drift, context handoff, and delivery quality. spec-superflow converges the two most relevant capabilities (OpenSpec-style change management + Superpowers-style execution discipline) into one state-machine pipeline, and internalizes requirement questioning and context handoff as inner loops.

| Similar approach | Risk it controls | How it maps here | Difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| [grill-me](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/tree/main/skills/productivity/grill-me) | Vague requirements, unclear boundaries and acceptance | `need-explorer` one question at a time + 2-3 option comparison → DP-0/DP-1 | Internalized as a workflow step, not a pluggable skill |
| [Spec-Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) | Define specs before plans and tasks | `spec-writer` + Schema engine (enforced SHALL/MUST/Scenario) | Artifacts are machine-checked, not just stage documents |
| [OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec) | Ongoing changes and archiving in brownfield projects | `changes/<name>/` artifacts + `spec-merger` + closing archive | Absorbed at source level; active changes read only the change folder |
| [Trellis](https://github.com/mindfold-ai/Trellis) | Context lost between sessions, tasks cannot hand off | `.spec-superflow.yaml` state machine + `ssf checkpoint` / `ssf handoff` + plan revisions | Content-level state files and verifiable receipts replace a project memory folder |
| [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) | Implementation quality and delivery process | `build-executor` TDD iron law + SDD + review gates + review receipts | Absorbed at source level, and "done" must be backed by a persisted receipt |

Four differences from "install several skills and combine them":

- **Single entry:** `workflow-start` is the only entry point, and guards block illegal transitions — no competing main flows.
- **Risk-graded:** `ssf workflow recommend` recommends Full / Hotfix / Quick / Tweak from eight facts; picking a non-recommended path requires explicit acknowledgement.
- **Evidence over ceremony:** review receipts, `test_result: pass`, and execution-plan revisions are verifiable evidence, not "the doc says it was executed".
- **Integrated delivery:** there is no partial adoption (for example, review gates without the state machine).

## Core Skills

| # | Skill | Stage | Purpose |
|---|-------|-------|---------|
| 1 | `workflow-start` | Entry | Content-level state detection, 8-state routing, blocks illegal transitions |
| 2 | `need-explorer` | Exploring | One question at a time, approach comparison, recommendation |
| 3 | `spec-writer` | Specifying | Generate proposal/specs/design/tasks with Schema engine validation |
| 4 | `contract-builder` | Bridging | Parse 4 artifacts → compress into execution-contract.md |
| 5 | `build-executor` | Executing | TDD Iron Law + SDD subagent-driven + Review Gates |
| 6 | `bug-investigator` | Debugging | 4-phase root cause analysis; 3+ failures → escalate |
| 7 | `code-reviewer` | Review | Structured review with 3-level severity classification |
| 8 | `release-archivist` | Pre-closing within executing | Verification-before-completion + archive + risk summary |
| 9 | `spec-merger` | Pre-closing within executing | Delta spec → main spec merge with conflict detection |

**Path selection:** Quick, direct Hotfix, and Tweak remain lightweight: record the boundary and verification only. Full and legacy Hotfix require an execution contract, execution plan, and review receipt. Risks are explained for the user to choose from; they do not silently upgrade a path.

**DP-5 debugging gate:** Record every failed fix with `ssf debug attempt record` and distinct, verifiable evidence. Full/legacy Hotfix requires a current execution plan; Quick, direct Hotfix, Tweak, and lightweight use a valid workflow receipt matching the current selection, with the ledger bound to its stable authorization identity. Wave Review failures do not count as debugging attempts. DP-5 is persisted only after at least three failed attempts in that execution context and an explicit `ssf debug escalate ... --confirm`; generic `state set` cannot write or inject `dp_5_*`.

### Guarded execution plans

For Full/legacy Hotfix, DP-4 is a persisted, current execution plan at
`<change>/.superpowers/sdd/execution-plan.json`, rather than an arbitrary text
field or content stored in `execution-contract.md`. Run `ssf execution recommend`
first: it lists `inline`, `batch-inline`, and `sdd` from task count and wave
strategy, with auditable reasons, and saves a recommendation receipt at
`<change>/.superpowers/sdd/execution-recommendation.json`. The agent presents that recommendation and the
user records a choice with `--confirm`; `plan` and `revise` require a receipt matching the current
artifacts, contract, and waves. A non-recommended choice also requires
`--acknowledge-recommendation`. Batch Inline remains serial and never claims
parallel work.
Quick, direct Hotfix, and Tweak are exempt from contract, execution-plan, and review-receipt gates during their normal bounded path; they persist `test_result: pass` after verification. If Quick, direct Hotfix, Tweak, or lightweight reaches DP-5 debugging, a valid workflow receipt authorizes planless attempts and binds the ledger to the selection's stable authorization identity. Full/legacy Hotfix continues to require a current execution plan.

```bash
ssf execution recommend changes/my-change \
  --wave foundation:parallel:1.1,1.2 \
  --wave integration:serial:2.1:foundation --json
ssf execution plan changes/my-change --mode sdd --confirm --reason "independent work" \
  --wave foundation:parallel:1.1,1.2 \
  --wave integration:serial:2.1:foundation
ssf execution show changes/my-change --json
# Retains/upgrades an existing plan as sdd; it can replan waves and dependencies,
# creates a new revision, and clears old review receipts. Downgrades are rejected.
ssf execution recommend changes/my-change \
  --wave foundation:parallel:1.1,1.2 \
  --wave integration:serial:2.1:foundation --json
ssf execution revise changes/my-change --mode sdd --confirm --reason "need parallel work" \
  --wave foundation:parallel:1.1,1.2 \
  --wave integration:serial:2.1:foundation
ssf execution review changes/my-change --wave foundation --base <sha> --head <sha> \
  --report .superpowers/sdd/reviews/foundation.md --verdict pass
ssf execution adjudicate changes/my-change --wave foundation --decision allow-review \
  --confirm --reason "reviewed the unresolved findings and authorizes one focused review"
```

The `--report` path is resolved relative to `<change>` and must remain under
`<change>/.superpowers/sdd/reviews/`. `--base` and `--head` must be real commits
in the `<change>` Git worktree, and `base` must be an ancestor of `head`.
The `<change>/.superpowers/sdd/reviews/` directory hierarchy must be physical,
non-symlink directories. The report itself must be a regular, non-empty,
non-symlink file.

Every planned wave needs a current `pass` review receipt before dependent
waves or closing may proceed; revising a plan invalidates earlier receipts.
Adjudication never creates a pass or releases dependents. A failed authorized
review returns the wave to `adjudication-required` and needs a new human decision.
Recovery, switching, and manual save form a control-plane overlay, not a ninth
workflow state; their CLI and CodeBuddy/WorkBuddy Markdown adapters keep the
same guards.

### Fast Paths (Quick / Hotfix / Tweak)

- **Quick** — ≤3 single-module code files/tasks → direct acceptance when low risk; for PRD, Spec/Design, API, data/permission, or cross-module impact, show the risk and let the user choose Quick or Full. A chosen Quick records `tdd`, `new-test`, or `bounded` verification.
- **direct Hotfix** — incident, ≤2 files/tasks → direct path plus original-symptom regression.
- **legacy Hotfix** — no direct receipt → minimal contract, DP-3, execution plan, and review remain required.
- **tweak** — ≤4 files, config/docs only → skip planning + bridging, direct edit

## Model Profiles (Optional Configuration)

Configure platform model IDs for execution roles in the project-root `spec-superflow.config.json`:

```json
{
  "models": {
    "mechanical": "vendor-small",
    "standard": "vendor-standard",
    "strong": "vendor-strong",
    "review": "vendor-review"
  }
}
```

| Profile | Role |
|---|---|
| `mechanical` | Low-cost, routine edits |
| `standard` | Integration and judgment work |
| `strong` | Architecture, design, and final review |
| `review` | Code review that matches the diff |

Resolve a profile in read-only mode:

```bash
ssf config --resolve-model mechanical
```

This command only resolves local configuration, does not call platform APIs, and does not switch models in the current session. The controller explicitly passes the returned model ID only to platforms whose dispatch supports a `model` field. A `configured: false` result means automatic selection is unavailable: never invent a provider model and continue to meet the existing explicit `model` requirement.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>How is this different from OpenSpec or Superpowers?</strong></summary>

spec-superflow is a source-level fusion, not side-by-side installation. It absorbs OpenSpec's Schema/validation/parsing engine and Superpowers' TDD/SDD/debugging/review discipline, while adding a unique contract-builder bridge layer and 8-state routing. Self-contained — no upstream runtimes needed.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does it compare to grill-me / Trellis / Spec-Kit?</strong></summary>

Each controls one risk layer: grill-me for requirement questioning, Trellis for context handoff, Spec-Kit for stage-based specs. spec-superflow converges these layers into one state-machine pipeline where a change has exactly one main flow and other capabilities only serve as inner loops. Use the individual tool if you only need one layer; use spec-superflow for the full chain. See [Comparison with Similar Approaches](#comparison-with-similar-approaches).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use this alongside existing OpenSpec or Superpowers?</strong></summary>

Not recommended in the same session. Projects with existing OpenSpec artifacts can be adopted directly — `contract-builder` reads your existing proposal/specs/design/tasks to generate the execution contract.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does the execution contract detect staleness?</strong></summary>

Content-level detection, not timestamps: proposal scope changed, approved spec behavior changed, design constraints changed, or task batches changed → contract marked stale → route back to `contract-builder`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does SDD (Subagent-Driven Development) work?</strong></summary>

For Full/legacy Hotfix, `ssf execution recommend` first presents Inline, Batch Inline,
and SDD with evidence from the change, then recommends one. The user confirms a
selection with `--confirm`; a different selection requires
`--acknowledge-recommendation`. The saved execution plan at
`<change>/.superpowers/sdd/execution-plan.json` names waves, dependencies, and
strategies before dispatching implementers. Each wave gets a review report and a
`pass`/`fail` receipt. Batch Inline remains serial, and the progress ledger
prevents session-compression loss.
